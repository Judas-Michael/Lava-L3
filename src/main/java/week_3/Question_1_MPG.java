/**
 *

 Write a program to calculate the MPG for a car journey.
 (MPG = Miles per gallon, calculate by dividing number of miles by number of gallons of gas used).

 Write a method called mpg that has two arguments:
 - a number of miles driven, and
 - a number of gallons of gas used on a car journey
 And returns a double value, representing the MPG for the journey.

 Your method should calculate and return the MPG for the car journey.  Your main method should
 -	Ask the user for the miles and gas used
 -	Call your method
 -	Use the returned data to display the MPG
